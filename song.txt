The Last Sled

There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting
It's luring me on as of old!
Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting so much as just finding the gold!
It's the great, big, broad land ‘way up yonder!

The great, broad land ‘way up yonder
Haunting him as of old
Yet, it ain't the gold itself

So much as finding the gold
Farewell, White Agony Creek
Farewell, the three long years
 
Can't leave behind what's in this sled

Things we lost
The things we couldn't share
Another rainbow's end
Another memory

Fortuna Favet Fortibus!
Hold on to all that's dear to you
As the last sled to Dawson finally arrives.

It's the forests where silence has lease
It's the beauty that fills me with wonder!
It's the stillness that fills me with peace!

The stillness that fills him with peace
The beauty of the wild
Rainbow's end with golden dreams
Starlit sky and coffee and beans
Farewell, White Agony Creek
Farewell, the three spring thaws
One day I will return to you

Things we lost
The things we couldn't share
Another rainbow's end
Another memory
Fortuna Favet Fortibus!
Hold on to all that's dear to you
As the last sled to Dawson finally arrives
