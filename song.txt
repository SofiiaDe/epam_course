There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting
It's luring me on as of old!
Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting so much as just finding the gold!
It's the great, big, broad land ‘way up yonder!

The great, broad land ‘way up yonder
Haunting him as of old
Yet, it ain't the gold itself

Things we lost
The things we couldn't share
Another rainbow's end
Another memory
Fortuna Favet Fortibus!
Hold on to all that's dear to you
As the last sled to Dawson finally arrives
